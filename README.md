# Awful AI
**Awful AI** is a curated list to track *current* scary usages of AI - hoping to raise awareness to its misuses in society



Artificial intelligence in its current state is [unfair](https://github.com/rockita/criticalML) and easily [susceptible to attacks](http://www.cleverhans.io/security/privacy/ml/2016/12/16/breaking-things-is-easy.html). Nevertheless, more and more concerning the uses of AI technology are appearing in the wild. This list aims to track *all of them*. We hope that *Awful AI* can be a platform to spur discussion for the development of possible contestational technology (to fight back!).

## Surveillance

[Gait Analysis](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/about-us/programmes/science-and-law/royal-society-forensic-gait-analysis-primer-for-courts.pdf) - Your gait is highly complex, very much unique and hard, if not impossible, to mask in this era of CCTV. Your gait only needs to be recorded once and associated with your identity, for you to be tracked in real-time. [In China](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/big-in-china-machines-that-scan-your-face/554075/) this kind of surveillance is already deployed. In addition, multiple people have been convicted on their gait alone in the west. We can no longer stay even modestly anonymous in public.

[SenseTime](https://www.sensetime.com/intelligentVideo/84) & [Megvii](https://megvii.com/)- Based on Face Recognition technology powered by deep learning algorithm, SenseFace and Megvii provides integrated solutions of intelligent video analysis, which functions in target surveillance, trajectory analysis, population management [[summary](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-facialrecognition-analysis/backing-big-brother-chinese-facial-recognition-firms-appeal-to-funds-idUSKBN1DD00A)][[forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/shuchingjeanchen/2018/03/07/the-faces-behind-chinas-omniscient-video-surveillance-technology/#54401e4f4afc)][[The Economist (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lH2gMNrUuEY)]

## Contestational research

> Research to create a less awful and more privacy-preserving AI

[Differential Privacy](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/06/15/what-is-differential-privacy/) - A formal definition of privacy that allows us to make theoretical guarantees on data breaches. AI algorithms can be trained to be differentially private [[original paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/asmith/PS/sensitivity-tcc-final.pdf)]

[Privacy-Preservation using Trusted Hardware](https://tvm.ai/2018/10/09/ml-in-tees.html) - AI algorithms that can run inside trusted hardware enclaves (or [private blockchains](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p2086-hynes.pdf) that build upon it) and train without any shareholder having access to private data

[Fair Machine Learning & Algorithm Bias](https://thegradient.pub/ai-bias/) - A subfield in AI that investigates different fairness criteria and algorithm bias. A recent [best paper (in ICLR18)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/17/delayed-impact/), e.g. shows that implementing specific criteria can have a delayed impact on fairness.

## Contestational tech projects

> These open source projects try to spur discourse, offer protection or awareness to awful AI

[Data Selfie](https://dataselfie.it/#/) - Data Selfie is a browser extension that tracks you while you are on Facebook to show you your own data traces and reveal what machine learning algorithms could predict about your personality based on that data [[code](https://github.com/d4t4x/data-selfie)]

[AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/) - AdNauseam is a lightweight browser extension to fight back against tracking by advertising networks. It works like an ad-blocker (it is built atop uBlock-Origin) to silently simulate clicks on each blocked ad, confusing trackers as to one's real interests [[code](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam)]

[B.S Detector](http://bsdetector.tech/) - B.S. Detector is a browser extension that searches all links on a given webpage for references to unreliable sources, checking against a manually compiled list of domains. It then provides visual warnings about the presence of questionable links or the browsing of questionable websites [[code](https://github.com/bs-detector/bs-detector)]

[Snopes.com](https://www.snopes.com/) - The Snopes.com website was founded by David Mikkelson, a project begun in 1994 and has since grown into the oldest and largest fact-checking site on the Internet, one widely regarded by journalists, folklorists, and laypersons alike as one of the world’s essential resources

[Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/facebook-container/) - Facebook Container isolates your Facebook activity from the rest of your web activity in order to prevent Facebook from tracking you outside of the Facebook website via third-party cookies [[code](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook)]

[TrackMeNot](https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/) - TrackMeNot is a browser extension (Chrome, Firefox) that helps protect your online searches by creating fake search queries. This creates noise in data that makes it harder to track and profile user behaviour. [[code](https://github.com/vtoubiana/TrackMeNot)]
