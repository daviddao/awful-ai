# Awful AI

**Awful AI** is a curated list to track *current* scary usages of AI - hoping to raise awareness to its misuses in society

Artificial intelligence in its current state is [unfair](https://github.com/rockita/criticalML), [easily susceptible to attacks](http://www.cleverhans.io/security/privacy/ml/2016/12/16/breaking-things-is-easy.html) and [notoriously difficult to control](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml). Often, AI systems and predictions [amplify existing systematic biases](https://twitter.com/kaiwei_chang/status/1274845029933084673) even when the data is balanced. Nevertheless, more and more concerning uses of AI technology are appearing in the wild. This list aims to track *all of them*. We hope that *Awful AI* can be a platform to spur discussion for the development of possible preventive technology (to fight back!).

You can [cite the list](https://zenodo.org/record/5855972#.YeQUyFjMI-Q) and raise more awareness through Zenodo.

## Discrimination

[Dermatology App](https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7evmy/googles-new-dermatology-app-wasnt-designed-for-people-with-darker-skin) By training with a dataset with only 3.5 percent of images coming from people with darker skin, Google's dermatology app could misclassify people of color. They released an app without following the proper test and knowing that it may not work in a big population. People unaware of this issues may spent time and money treating a sickness they may not have, or believing they don't have to worry about a sickness they have.

[Increase fossil fuel production](https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/oil-in-the-cloud) - As the oil and gas industry confronts the end of the oil age and deteriorating earnings, major oil corporations such as Shell, BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil and others have turned to the tech companies and artificial intelligence to find and extract more oil and gas, reduce production costs and extending global warming. 
The World Economic Forum has estimated that advanced analytics and modeling could generate at much as [$425 billion in value](http://reports.weforum.org/digital-transformation/wp-content/blogs.dir/94/mp/files/pages/files/white-paper-2017-dti-oil-gas.pdf) for the oil and gas sector by 2025. AI technologies could boost production levels [by as much as 5%](https://corporate.exxonmobil.com/News/Newsroom/News-releases/2019/0305_ExxonMobil-to-increase-accelerate-Permian-output-to-1-million-barrels-per-day-by-2024). [[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3n8txX3144)]

[Overestimate carbon credits](https://www.propublica.org/article/the-climate-solution-actually-adding-millions-of-tons-of-co2-into-the-atmosphere) - Forest carbon credits are bought by emitters to get to net zero. Over issuing carbon credits have a devastating effect in allowing emitters to emit more than legally allowed. This is already happening on a systematic level. Carbonplan found out that 29% of the offsets analyzed were over-credited, totaling an additional 30 million tCO₂e. Recent research suggests, that [AI-based estimations](https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/icml2021/79) can accelerate this problem and significantly overcredit carbon offsets. [[Technical Report](https://carbonplan.org/research/forest-offsets-explainer)][[map](https://carbonplan.org/research/forest-offsets)]



## Autonomous weapon systems and military

[Lethal autonomous weapons systems](https://autonomousweapons.org/) - Autonomous weapons locate, select, and engage targets without human intervention. They include, for example, [armed quadcopters (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CO6M2HsoIA) that can search for and eliminate enemy combatants in a city using facial recognition. [[NY Times (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFD_Cgr2zho)]

### Known autonomous weapons projects:
- [Automated machine gun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OqmoHBvB0c) - The Kalashnikov group presented an automatic weapon control station using AI that provides the operator with automatic recognition and target illumination and automatic tracking of ground, air and sea targets. Samsung developed and deployed [SGR-A1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGR-A1), a robot sentry gun, which uses voice recognition and tracking.
- [Armed UAVs](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1149168.shtml) - Ziyan UAV develops armed autonomous drones with light machine guns and explosives that can act in swarms
- [Autonomous Tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unmanned_ground_vehicle) - Uran-9 is an autonomous tank, developed by Russia, that was tested in the [Syrian Civil War](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/russias-uran-9-robot-tank-went-war-syria-it-didnt-go-very-well-40677)
- [Robot dogs with guns](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726111/robot-dogs-with-guns-sword-international-ghost-robotics) - Ghost Robotics equippes robotic dogs with a lethal weapons. The SPUR gun is designed to be fitted onto a variety of robotic platforms and is unmanned.



### Known incidents:

['Machine-gun with AI' used to kill Iran scientist](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-55214359) - A machine-gun mounted on the Nissan pick-up was equipped with an intelligent satellite system which zoomed in on an iranian scientist. The machine-gun controlled through artificial intelligence shot the scientist without hurting his wife, despite being only 25cm away.

### Weapons target tracking and intelligence
The startup [Modern Intelligence](https://www.modernintelligence.ai/) claims its AI will "save lives" by offering "warfighters" more precise target tracking and an enemy intelligence system that "learns." The company is [funded by VC firm Vine Ventures](https://medium.com/vine-ventures/why-we-invested-in-modern-intelligence-b0a2772345ca).

## Awful AI Award

> Every year this section gives out the *Awful AI award* for the most unethical research or event happening within the scientific community and beyond. Congratulations to AI researchers, companies and media for missing ethical guidelines - and failing to provide moral leadership.

### Winner 2022: Commercial AI Image Generators

**'Awful data stealing' 🥇**

**Laudation**:

Congratulations to commercial AI image generators such as [DALL·E-2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com/), [Lensa](https://prisma-ai.com/lensa), and others for unethically [stealing from artists without their consent](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/kelseyweekman/ai-art-app-lensa-instagram-photo-trend-problems), making a profit out of models that have been trained on their art without compensating them, and [automating and putting artists out of business](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/02/technology/ai-artificial-intelligence-artists.html). A special shoutout goes to OpenAI and Midjourney for keeping its training database of stolen artworks secret 👏

### Winner 2021: FastCompany & Checkr

**'Awful media reporting' 🥇**

**Laudation**:

Congratulations to [FastCompany](https://www.fastcompany.com/) for awarding [Checkr](), a [highly controversial](https://www.protocol.com/checkr-gig-economy-lawsuits) automated background check company, the [World Changing Ideas Awards for "fair" hiring](https://www.fastcompany.com/90623897/see-34-ingenious-inspirational-winners-of-the-2021-world-changing-ideas-awards). Instead of slow fingerprint-based background checks, Checkr uses several machine learning models to gather reports from public records which will contain bias and mistakes. [Dozens of lawsuits](https://www.agrusslawfirm.com/blog/controversial-background-check-startup-checkr-worth-$2-2-billion/) have been filed against Checkr since 2014 for erroneous information. Despite these ongoing controversies, we congratulate FastCompany for the audacity for turning the narrative and awarding Checkr instead its prize for "ethical" and "fair" AI use 👏

### Winner 2020: Google Research & the AI Twitter Community 

**'Awful role model award' 🥇**

**Laudation**: 

Congratulations to Google Research for sending an awful signal by [firing Dr. Timnit Gebru](https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382), one of very few Black women Research Scientists at the company, from her position as Co-Lead of Ethical AI after a dispute over her research, which focused on examining the environmental and ethical implications of large-scale AI language models 👏

Congratulations to the AI Twitter community for its increasing efforts on creating a space of [unsafe dialogue and toxic behaviour](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/retired-uw-computer-science-professor-embroiled-twitter-spat-ai-ethics-cancel-culture/) that [mobbed out many AI researchers such as Anima Anandkumar](https://animakumar.wpcomstaging.com/2020/12/16/my-departure-from-twitter/) (who led the [renaming of NIPS controversial acryonym](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07476-w) into NeurIPS) 👏

### Winner 2019: NeurIPS Conference

**'Scary research award' 🥇**

**Laudation**: 

Congratulations to NeurIPS 2019, one of the world's top venue for AI research, and its reviewers for accepting unethical papers into the conference. Some examples are listed below 👏

[Face Reconstruction from Voice using Generative Adversarial Networks
](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8768-face-reconstruction-from-voice-using-generative-adversarial-networks) - This paper addresses the challenge to reconstruct someone's face from their voice. Given an audio clip spoken by an unseen person, the proposed algorithm pictures a face that has as many common elements, or associations as possible with the speaker, in terms of identity. The model can generate faces that match several biometric characteristics of the speaker and results in matching accuracies that are much better than chance. [[code](https://github.com/cmu-mlsp/reconstructing_faces_from_voices)]
**Category: Surveillance**

[Predicting the Politics of an Image Using Webly Supervised Data
](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/8621-predicting-the-politics-of-an-image-using-webly-supervised-data) - This paper collects a dataset of over one million unique images and associated news articles from left- and right-leaning news sources, and develops a method to predict and adjust the image's political leaning, outperforming strong baselines. **Category: Discrimination**

Update (2020): NeurIPS 2020 has since implemented ethical reviews that [flag and reject unethical papers](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03611-8).

## Contestational research

> Research to create a less awful and more privacy-preserving AI

[Differential Privacy](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2016/06/15/what-is-differential-privacy/) - A formal definition of privacy that allows us to make theoretical guarantees on data breaches. AI algorithms can be trained to be differentially private. [[original paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/asmith/PS/sensitivity-tcc-final.pdf)]

[Privacy-Preservation using Trusted Hardware](https://tvm.ai/2018/10/09/ml-in-tees.html) - AI algorithms that can run inside trusted hardware enclaves (or [private blockchains](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p2086-hynes.pdf) that build upon it) and train without any shareholder having access to private data.

[Privacy-Preservation using Secure Computation](https://mortendahl.github.io/2017/09/19/private-image-analysis-with-mpc/) - Using secure computation techniques like secret sharing, Yao's garbled circuits, or homomorphic encryption to train and deploy private machine learning models on private data using [existing machine learning frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08130).

[Fair Machine Learning & Algorithm Bias](https://thegradient.pub/ai-bias/) - A subfield in AI that investigates different fairness criteria and algorithm bias. A recent [best paper (in ICLR18)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/17/delayed-impact/), e.g. shows that implementing specific criteria can have a delayed impact on fairness.

[Adversarial Machine Learning](https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/) - Adversarial examples are inputs, which cause the model to make a mistake. Research in adversarial defences includes but is not limited to adversarial training, distillation and Defense-GAN.

[Towards Truthful Language Models](https://openai.com/blog/improving-factual-accuracy/) - Language models like GPT-3 are useful for many different tasks, but have a tendency to “hallucinate” information when performing tasks requiring obscure real-world knowledge. OpenAI requires research model to cite its sources, allowing humans to evaluate factual accuracy by checking whether a claim is supported by a reliable source. 

## Contestational tech projects

> These open-source projects try to spur discourse, offer protection or awareness to awful AI

[Have I Been Trained](haveibeentrained.com) - With HaveIBeenTrained, artists can search databases which large image generation models like Stable Diffusion have been trained on for links to their work and flag them for removal. Spawning (the creator behind HaveIBeenTrained) partners with Laion, who built these datasets, to remove those links. This helps ensure that future models will not be trained with work that has been opted out.

[BLM Privacy & Anonymous Camera](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anonymous-camera/id1504102584) - AI facial recognition models can recognize blurred faces and is used by authorities to arrest protesters. BLM Privacy and Anonymous Camera tries to discourage people from trying to recognize or reconstruct pixelated faces by masking people with an opaque mask. [[code](https://github.com/StanfordMLGroup/blm)][[BLM privacy](https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/blm)]

[AdNauseam](https://adnauseam.io/) - AdNauseam is a lightweight browser extension to fight back against tracking by advertising networks. It works like an ad-blocker (it is built atop uBlock-Origin) to silently simulate clicks on each blocked ad, confusing trackers as to one's real interests. [[code](https://github.com/dhowe/AdNauseam)]

[Snopes.com](https://www.snopes.com/) - The Snopes.com website was founded by David Mikkelson, a project begun in 1994 and has since grown into the oldest and largest fact-checking site on the Internet, one widely regarded by journalists, folklorists, and laypersons alike as one of the world’s essential resources.

[Facebook Container](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/facebook-container/) - Facebook Container isolates your Facebook activity from the rest of your web activity to prevent Facebook from tracking you outside of the Facebook website via third-party cookies. [[code](https://github.com/mozilla/contain-facebook)]

[TrackMeNot](https://cs.nyu.edu/trackmenot/) - TrackMeNot is a browser extension (Chrome, Firefox) that helps protect your online searches by creating fake search queries. This creates noise in data that makes it harder to track and profile user behaviour. [[code](https://github.com/vtoubiana/TrackMeNot)]

[Center for Democracy & Technology](https://cdt.info/ddtool/) - Digital Decisions is an interactive graphic that helps you ask the right questions when designing/implementing or building a new algorithm.

[TensorFlow KnowYourData](https://knowyourdata.withgoogle.com/) - A platform to help researchers, engineers, product teams, and decision makers understand 70+ datasets with the goal of improving data quality, and helping mitigate fairness and bias issues.

[Model and dataset cards](https://modelcards.withgoogle.com/about) - Model and [dataset](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v1.12.0/dataset_card.html) cards encourage transparent reporting for ML models and datasets. They are short documents accompanying ML models or datasets that provide benchmarked evaluation in a variety of conditions, such as across different cultural, demographic, or phenotypic groups (e.g., race, geographic location, sex, Fitzpatrick skin type) and intersectional groups (e.g., age and race, or sex and Fitzpatrick skin type). They also disclose the context and limits in which datasets and models are intended to be used, details of the performance evaluation procedures, and other relevant information. [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993)][[blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/introducing-model-card-toolkit-for.html)]
