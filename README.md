Awful AI
===

**Awful AI** is a curated list to track *current* scary usages of AI - hoping to raise awareness to its misuses in society

Artificial intelligence in its current state is [unfair](https://github.com/rockita/criticalML), [easily susceptible to attacks](http://www.cleverhans.io/security/privacy/ml/2016/12/16/breaking-things-is-easy.html) and [notoriously difficult to control](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml). Often, AI systems and predictions [amplify existing systematic biases](https://twitter.com/kaiwei_chang/status/1274845029933084673) even when the data is balanced. Nevertheless, more and more concerning uses of AI technology are appearing in the wild. This list aims to track *all of them*. We hope that *Awful AI* can be a platform to spur discussion for the development of possible preventive technology (to fight back!).

You can [cite the list](https://zenodo.org/record/5855972#.YeQUyFjMI-Q) and raise more awareness through Zenodo.

# Annual Awful AI Award

> Every year this section gives out the *Awful AI award* for the most unethical research or event happening within the scientific community and beyond. Congratulations to AI researchers, companies and media for missing ethical guidelines - and failing to provide moral leadership.

### Winner 2023: Israel's Use of AI in Gaza Conflict

**'Awful AI in Warfare' 🥇**

**Laudation**:

This year's Awful AI Award goes to the Israel Defense Forces for their use of the AI-driven platform ["the Gospel"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/dec/01/the-gospel-how-israel-uses-ai-to-select-bombing-targets) in the Gaza Strip, marking a disturbing milestone in the application of artificial intelligence in warfare. By significantly accelerating the process of selecting bombing targets, this AI 'factory' has not only increased the number of strikes within a densely populated area but also raised profound ethical and humanitarian concerns. The use of such technology in conflict, which potentially risks the lives of countless civilians, highlights the dire need for international regulations and ethical guidelines in the deployment of AI in military operations. We recognize this alarming development as a call to action for the global community to address the grave implications of AI in warfare, ensuring that technological advancements do not come at the cost of human lives and ethical integrity. 

## Past Winners

Congratulations to the AI Twitter community for its increasing efforts on creating a space of [unsafe dialogue and toxic behaviour](https://www.geekwire.com/2020/retired-uw-computer-science-professor-embroiled-twitter-spat-ai-ethics-cancel-culture/) that [mobbed out many AI researchers such as Anima Anandkumar](https://animakumar.wpcomstaging.com/2020/12/16/my-departure-from-twitter/) (who led the [renaming of NIPS controversial acronym](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-07476-w) into NeurIPS) 👏 |
