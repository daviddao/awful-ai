# Awful AI
**Awful AI** is a curated list to track *current* scary usages of AI - hoping to raise awareness to its misuses in society



Artificial intelligence in its current state is [unfair](https://github.com/rockita/criticalML), [easily susceptible to attacks](http://www.cleverhans.io/security/privacy/ml/2016/12/16/breaking-things-is-easy.html) and [notoriously difficult to control](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vRPiprOaC3HsCf5Tuum8bRfzYUiKLRqJmbOoC-32JorNdfyTiRRsR7Ea5eWtvsWzuxo8bjOxCG84dAg/pubhtml). Nevertheless, more and more concerning the uses of AI technology are appearing in the wild. This list aims to track *all of them*. We hope that *Awful AI* can be a platform to spur discussion for the development of possible contestational technology (to fight back!).

## Discrimination

[AI-based Gaydar](https://osf.io/zn79k/) - Artificial intelligence can accurately guess whether people are gay or straight based on photos of their faces, according to new research that suggests machines can have significantly better “gaydar” than humans.

[Racist Auto Tag](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/01/google-sorry-racist-auto-tag-photo-app) - a Google image recognition program labeled the faces of several black people as gorillas. Amazon's Rekognition labeled darker-skinned women as men 31 percent of the time. Lighter-skinned women were misidentified 7 percent of the time.

In the case of Amazon, the algorithm quickly taught itself to prefer male candidates over female ones, penalizing CVs that included the word "women's," such as "women's chess club captain." It also reportedly downgraded graduates of two all-women's colleges.

[Gait Analysis](https://royalsociety.org/~/media/about-us/programmes/science-and-law/royal-society-forensic-gait-analysis-primer-for-courts.pdf) - Your gait is highly complex, very much unique and hard, if not impossible, to mask in this era of CCTV. Your gait only needs to be recorded once and associated with your identity, for you to be tracked in real-time. [In China](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/04/big-in-china-machines-that-scan-your-face/554075/) this kind of surveillance is already deployed. In addition, multiple people have been convicted on their gait alone in the west. We can no longer stay even modestly anonymous in public.

## Misleading platforms, and scams

[Misleading Show Robots](https://www.forbes.com/sites/noelsharkey/2018/11/17/mama-mia-its-sophia-a-show-robot-or-dangerous-platform-to-mislead/) - Show robots such as [Sophia](https://www.hansonrobotics.com/) are being used as a platform to falsely represent the current state of AI and to actively deceive the public into believing that current AI has human-like intelligence or is very close to it. This is especially harmful as it appeared on the world's leading forum for international security policy. By giving a false impression of where AI is today, it helps defense contractors and those pushing military AI technology to sell their ideas. [[Criticism by LeCun](https://www.facebook.com/yann.lecun/posts/10155025943382143)]

[Zach](https://thespinoff.co.nz/the-best-of/06-03-2018/the-mystery-of-zach-new-zealands-all-too-miraculous-medical-ai/) - an AI, developed by the Terrible Foundation, claimed to write better reports than medical doctors. The technology generated large media attention in New Zealand but turned out to be a [misleading scam](https://thespinoff.co.nz/the-best-of/09-03-2018/the-mystery-of-zach-the-miracle-ai-continued-it-all-just-gets-terribler/) aiming to steal money from investors.

## Contestational research

> Research to create a less awful and more privacy-preserving AI

AI algorithms can be trained to be differentially private. [[original paper](http://people.csail.mit.edu/asmith/PS/sensitivity-tcc-final.pdf)]

[Privacy-Preservation using Trusted Hardware](https://tvm.ai/2018/10/09/ml-in-tees.html) - AI algorithms that can run inside trusted hardware enclaves (or [private blockchains](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p2086-hynes.pdf) that build upon it) and train without any shareholder having access to private data.

[Privacy-Preservation using Secure Computation](https://mortendahl.github.io/2017/09/19/private-image-analysis-with-mpc/) - Using secure computation techniques like secret sharing, Yao's garbled circuits, or homomorphic encryption to train and deploy private machine learning models on private data using [existing machine learning frameworks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08130).

[Fair Machine Learning & Algorithm Bias](https://thegradient.pub/ai-bias/) - A subfield in AI that investigates different fairness criteria and algorithm bias. A recent [best paper (in ICLR18)](https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2018/05/17/delayed-impact/), e.g. shows that implementing specific criteria can have a delayed impact on fairness.

[Adversarial Machine Learning](https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/) - Adversarial examples are inputs, which cause the model to make a mistake. Research in adversarial defenses includes but is not limited to adversarial training, distillation and Defense-GAN.
